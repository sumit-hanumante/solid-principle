                        Open/Closed Principle

    It States that Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension,
    but closed for modification.


     To be precise, according to this principle, a class should be written in such a manner that
     it performs its job flawlessly without the assumption that people in the future will simply
     come and change it.
     Hence, the class should remain closed for modification,
     but it should have the option to get extended.

     Ways of extending the class include:

        #. Inheriting from the class
        #. Overwriting the required behaviors from the class
        #. Extending certain behaviors of the class
