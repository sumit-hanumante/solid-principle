                Liskov Substitution Principle



        A class can be replaced by its subclass in all practical usage scenarios.


The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses
without breaking the application.
That requires the objects of your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass.
